</head>

  <h1> SixTrack  - Ideas for GSoC 2014 </h1>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<a href="http://cern.ch/sixtrack">SixTrack</a> simulates the trajectory of
high energy particles in accelerators. It has been used in the design and
optimization of the LHC and now of the HL-LHC upgrade. The code supports many
different computer platforms and its running environment can profit from the
volunteer computing resources through the <a
  href="cern.ch/lhcathome">LHC@Home</a> project.

The source code is written in Fortran, pre-processed by two programs that
assemble code blocks and provide automatic differentiation on the equations of
motion. The code relies on the <a
href="http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/www/crlibm/">crlibm</a> library, careful
arrangement of parenthesis, dedicated input/output and selected compilation
flags for the most common compilers to provide identical results on different
platforms and operating systems. The code can be linked to the <a
  href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu">Boinc</a> library for the volunteering
computer project.  A running environment SixDesk is used to generate input
files, split simulations for LHC@Home or CERN cluster and collect the results
for the user.

The code is licensed under LGPLv2.1 under CERN copyright.

<h3> Ideas </h3>

Ideal students have a strong background in computer science and programming
languages as well the interest in understanding the computational physics
methods implemented in the code. He or she will face the challenge of working
with an high performance production code whose reliability and backward
compatibility cannot be compromised and be trained in the methods used in
simulating the motion of particles in accelerators.

<p><h3>Simulating time dependent functions</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Implement, test and put in production the
ability to change the strength, misalignment of any element by applying a
function composed by predefined branch like linear, parabolic, sinusoidal,
white notes and colored (by using IIR filters) noise.
<p><strong>Expected results:</strong> The user will have the option to define magnet strengths as a function of time from the input files.
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Fortran, calculus.


<p><h3>New physics models</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Implement, test and put in production a new
tracking map for exact bending dipoles, includes per-particle mass and charge
state, track total time.  <p><strong>Expected results:</strong> The user can
build accelerator simulations with more accurate models for low energy
machines.  <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Fortran, calculus,  accelerator
physics.

<p><h3>Database infrastructure for large scale simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Setup a MySQL database instance and develop
the supporting code to collect the results sent to volunteers or computer
clusters and provide them to the users. The code will allow to split a study
in smaller units of work, submit the study, query the state, re-submit missing
or invalid results, collect the data in users' SQLite database.
<p><strong>Expected results:</strong> The user will have a complete set of
tools to submit, follow and collect results from distributed computer
resources.
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> SQL, python, C/C++, Linux.

<p><h3> Nightly build system and tests</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SixTrack needs to be built and tested for
Linux, Windows, Mac with different compilers. It written in Fortran and needs
to be linked with a C++ library. This poses complications in the build system
that would be otherwise automatized to allow the continuous integration of new
features in the volunteer computing environment. The work consist in
formalizing the building procedures, write small test units to validate
extensive portion of the code and write scripts for automatic building and
testing.  <p><strong>Expected results:</strong> Any new
commit released in SVN will be automatically built and tested.
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Fortran, C/C++, Makefile, Visual Studio, Cygwin, Xcode, gcc.

<h3>Standalone tracking library </h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Define an API for particle tracking, re-write
the implemented model as a standalone module in C and re-factor the existing
code such that it will use the new library. The API and the module should open
the way to GPU or multicore architectures.
<p><strong>Expected results:</strong> The code will rely only on the newly
rewritten library to perform tracking simulations.
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Fortran, C, calculus, physics.
