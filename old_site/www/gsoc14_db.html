  <h1> SixTrack  - Ideas for GSoC 2014 - Database infrastructure for large scale simulations </h1>

The goal of the project is to substitute the existing mechanism of collecting
and distributing the simulations results managed by the Boinc[1] server
running the LHC@Home[2] project and by the CERN cluster, while being
compatible with the existing simulation environment SixDesk[3].

<li>[2] cern.ch/lhcathome</li>
<li>[3] cern.ch/SixTrack/doc/sixdesk/sixdesk_env.html</li>
</ul>


A brief description of the simulation workflow is the following. A
simulation is identified by the values of a certain number of parameters
(~6 fields) defining a grid. Those parameters are used to generate input
files for SixTrack that returns a table of results (60 fields) and set of
output files after being run either on the local machine of a volunteer or
on one of the CERN cluster. At the moment the input files are created in
shared filesystem (openAFS) on a deep tree of directories that host also
the results of the simulations. When simulations are dispatched to the
LHC@Home volunteers, the input files are packed and copied on a spool
directory, the Boinc server send them to volunteers and collect the result
in another spool directory. The users from time to time collect the
results back in the directory tree.

The large number of small files generated can exceed the capabilities of
the filesystem (but not the disk space) and slow down all the operations.
The goal of this project is to use sqlite3 files to substitute the user
directory tree and a centralized database to manage the exchange of input
and results for the LHC@Home project.

You could have a quick look at the python code in

http://sixtrack.web.cern.ch/SixTrack/www/sixdeskpy

which contains a a first prototype of what we would like to achieve and
shows the libraries used (sqlite3, numpy, matplolib).

In particular:
<ul>
<li> sqltable.py which provides generic functions to translate back and fort
sqlite query results and numpy array and</li>
<li> sixdeskdb.py which contains specialized code for the user database
management and some of the analysis on the simulation data.</li>
</ul>

You can also have a look to user manual of the existing environment

http://sixtrack.web.cern.ch/SixTrack/doc/sixdesk/sixdesk_env.html

The milestones I see are the following:
<ul>
<li>  translate the post processing routines using sqlite3 user database
(partally done)</li>
<li>  setup and profile the centralized database to host the results</li>
<li>  write a deamon the consume the results spool and populate the
centrlized database</li>
<li>  write the scripts that transfers the results to the user database</li>
<li>  substitute the routine for cern cluster to feed directly the centralized
database</li>
<li>  substitute the routine in the boinc server assimilator to directly feed
the cntralized database</li>
</ul>
